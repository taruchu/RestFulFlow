Research NoSQL vs SQL vs blob stores (scales better for files) MONGO ??
Research libuv (roll my own event handler ?)
Research File storage options (blobs with SQL, or just Blobs, off-loading files after a number of days to blob from SQL)
Research service request paging techniques for huge data transfers (chat message searches, chat messages for a dataTime range)
Research Batch Processing techniques
	I think I'll use NOSQL to store the batch result in a JSON string with a schema specified by the batch service's envelope.
	There should be a batch job manager that the client can register with using a recipt that they get after making a request to 
	the batch service. The batch job manager will set up a callback so that when the job is complete it will send the result and or notification to the client.
	I should probably use a web socket for the interaction between the client and the batch job manager.

Organize a database so that it's tables represent a family of related services that have dependencies on common data. Don't mix multiple unrelated services into the 
same database.


Important:  Need a way to create the chat message channel before the client makes a request on it. I'll create a service for this.
